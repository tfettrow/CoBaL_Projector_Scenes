This folder contains the common code for any Workbench (Balance Advtange/Workbook) protocol that should have their visuals implimented in Unity.

The Plugins folder contains .NET 3.5 compatable versions of both Newtonsoft's Json (v9.0r1) module and websocket-csharp module (Jan 8 2017).
The JSON module is provided as-is from the public available download, while the Websocket class library has been modified from the orignal source code to
remove the Websocket Server functionality and to expose the WebSocket.IsConnected property as a public gettable value.

The icon.png is the suggested icon to be set with the project so that the deployed exe's get something visually identifiying for the tech support user.
